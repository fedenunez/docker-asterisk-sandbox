;===============ENDPOINT CONFIGURED FOR USE WITH A SIP PHONE==================
;
; This example includes the endpoint, auth and aor configurations. It
; requires inbound authentication and allows registration, as well as references
; a transport that you'll need to uncomment from the previous examples.
;
; Uncomment one of the transport lines to choose which transport you want. If
; not specified then the default transport chosen is the first compatible transport
; in the configuration file for the contact URL.
;
; Modify the "max_contacts=" line to change how many unique registrations to allow.
;
; Use the "contact=" line instead of max_contacts= if you want to statically
; define the location of the device.
;
; If using the TLS enabled transport, you may want the "media_encryption=sdes"
; option to additionally enable SRTP, though they are not mutually inclusive.
;
; If this endpoint were remote, and it was using a transport configured for NAT
; then you likely want to use "direct_media=no" to prevent audio issues.

;===============ENDPOINT BEHIND NAT OR FIREWALL===============================
;
; This example assumes your transport is configured with a public IP and the
; endpoint itself is behind NAT and maybe a firewall, rather than having
; Asterisk behind NAT. For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume a typical
; VOIP phone. The most important settings to configure are:
;
;  * direct_media, to ensure Asterisk stays in the media path
;  * rtp_symmetric and force_rport options to help the far-end NAT/firewall
;
; Depending on the settings of your remote SIP device or NAT/firewall device
; you may have to experiment with a combination of these settings.
;
; If both Asterisk and the remote phones are a behind NAT/firewall then you'll
; have to make sure to use a transport with appropriate settings (as in the
; transport-udp-nat example).
